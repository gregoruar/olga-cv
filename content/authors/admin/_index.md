I am a junior designer from Moscow. Moscow is my hometown, but now I live in Bordeaux.
A couple of years ago I graduated from the Faculty of Pharmacy, worked for 1 year in the Department of Registration and Quality, and now I am learning new things - drawing, typesetting. 
Design for me is beauty and benefit in one. My values are freedom, honesty and discovery, that is why my works are fresh, colourful and charming.
